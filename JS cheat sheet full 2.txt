Q1- What is the difference between some() and every()?

The difference between some() and every() is that some() applies a test on an array to check whether
it has atleast one element which passes the condition. On the other hand every() runs a test on an array
to check whether if all elements pass the test if any element fails than the loop stops.
Both this methods return either true or false.


Q2- What if we apply map() with a condition?

If we apply map() with a condition and than it will return elements which do pass the condition on the other hand
it will also return elements as "undifined" as there placeholder which do not pass the condtion.
